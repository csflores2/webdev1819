    In this exercise, use CSS to make everything written below true. You may add as many classes to elements as you want.

  <h1>
    This h1 should be orange
    <br>
    <span class="bold">Make this line not bold, half the size, and with a line through it.</span>
    
  </h1>

  <h2>
    Put everything in Helvetica.
  </h2>
  <section class="main" style="background-color: lightblue;">

  
    <div class="feature">
      <i>This line should be red and in italics.</i>
    </div>

    <div>
      <a href="http://google.com" class="link">Links shouldn't be underlined</a>
    </div>
  
    <p>
      Every section should have a green 3px dotted border, except this one, which should have a light blue background color, and a box  shadow of 10px with rounded corners.
    </p>
  
  <p>
    All sections should have 1 line of space between them. And they should all have 12px of padding on left and right.
  </p>
  </section>
  
  
  <section>

    <blockquote>
        Most <mark><em>emphasis</em></mark> should have a yellow background, but
        not <em class="secondary">this one</em>.
  </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely don't want this blockquote indented.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This paragraph can stay as is.
